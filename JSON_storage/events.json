    "description": "Having trouble navigating buzz terms such as Savings?\nStudent Debt? W9? Credit Reports? Well, these topics all lie under Personal Finance,\nwhich isnâ€™t necessarily taught in school. People tend to build these skills through family,\nmentors, role models, etc. Not everyone has this privilege, however. T\nhe goal of our event is to simply expand the accessibility of financial literacy.\n\nWe created a short curriculum highlighting important personal finance topics,\nwhich will be presented by two of the most renowned faculty members within\nBrown's Economics Department: Professor Bradford Gibbs and Professor Sylvia Kuo.\nMake sure to stop by if interested! Free pizza will be provided!"
