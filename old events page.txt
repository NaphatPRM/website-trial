                    The Econ DUG hosted a panel aimed at answering the most pertinent questions that prospective
                    economics concentrators have. The event was targeted at first years and sophomores, but all
                    prospective economics concentrators were welcomed. The panelists consisted of Professor
                    David Weil (previous Head of the Economics Department), Professor Bryce Steinberg ‘09,
                    Professor Kenneth Chay, international economics graduate student Vaishali Garga.

                    <b> Does Disease Cause Vaccination? - A Lunch with Prof Emily Oster</b> <br>
                    <i>February 15, 2017 </i> <br> <br>
                    The Econ DUG presented another lunch lecture in the series, featuring Professor Emily Oster.
                    Professor Oster’s research focuses on health and development economics. Attendees learned
                    about her work at the time focused on how individuals seek out, and react to, health
                    information. Her work is perhaps best-known among non-economists for her writings and
                    appearances in mainstream media, including the Wall Street Journal, the best-selling
                    SuperFreakonomics book, and her 2007 TED Talk. Catering was provided.
